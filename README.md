# QR Code Component Challenge

## Overview
This project is a Frontend mentpr challenge, the QR Code Component Challenge. The objective was to build a small displaying QR code, following the design in the Figma file. This challenge helped me practice layout alignment, styling, and attention to detail and all from analysing the figma file.
For this version, I recreated the project using Bootstrap classes to make it easier to style


## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hasnasalah/lab-bootstrap.git
## Challenge
I had to replace fixed widths, heights and custom margins with Bootstrap utility classes wherever possible, and only keep custom CSS for exact fonts, colors, and letter-spacing that Bootstrap doesn’t cover.
## Reflection
What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?
Using Bootstrap simplified the process of creating a responsive layout. It looks easier when you don't need to switch back and fort between vs code windows
2.How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?
The biggest challenge was balancing exact design  with Bootstrap’s built-in classes.
